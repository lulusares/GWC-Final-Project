    <p>Social Studies AP's usually include essays, so make sure that you take your time. When you're </p>
    <p>finished writing your essay, remember to ensure that you've covered all the requirements. There are </p>
    <p>usually a lot of MC questions and not a lot of time so even though you should manage your time,</p>
    <p>make sure that you read the whole question and give yourself a second to think of the correct answer. </p>
    <p>Don't rush! </p>

    <p> Science AP's usually have two sections; multiple choiceFRQs (Free Response Question) </p>
    <p> One thing to take note of is the in addition to multiple choice questions and FRQs, on the AP Biology</p>
    <p> exam, there are also Grid-ins, where you bubble in a numerical answer.  The general advice is</p>
    <p> to do the grid-ins first rather than the multiple choice since you can guess on MC questions but not</p>
    <p> necessarily on grid-ins.  Another important thing to remember is that for the FRQs, there are questions</p>
    <p> that have different lengths and different point values, so make sure you organize your time such that </p>
    <p>you take the 'importance' of the question into consideration.  In terms of studying, the best method </p>
    <p>generally to take a number of practice questions in areas that you aren't confident in in order to </p>
    <p>familiarize yourself with the question styles </p>

    <p class = "epara"> The format for the Language and Composition exam is around 55 multiple choice questions </p>
    <p class = "epara"> followed by 3 essays. As with the previous exams, practice is key, especially with the reading </p>
    <p class = "epara"> passages because you really never know what the College Board will throw at you; sometimes they </p>
    <p class = "epara"> give interesting and relevant articles, other times they can give studies from the 1800s </p>
    <p class = "epara"> that no one really cares about. One tip for the essays though, they tell you to write the </p>
    <p class = "epara"> synthesis and argumentative essay within the same time period, so make sure you manage your time </p>
    <p class = "epara"> correctly. In addition, if you can't think of any outside evidence for the argument essay, you </p>
    <p class = "epara"> can make up studies that prove your point as long as they sound plausible </p>

      <p> Foreign Language! Very very fun stuff </p>
      <p> The test generally consists of MC Reading passages, MC Reading + Listening passages, </p>
      <p> MC Listening passages, email writing, persuasive essay, and two speaking presentations. </p>
      <p> The speaking section is generally going to be a recording of your responses to a conversation </p>
      <p> played from a pre-recorded tape in addition to a cultural presentation, which is basically a </p>
      <p> minute monologue on a topic provided by the college board </p>
      <p> Again, the best way to study for these exams is to practice a lot! Find reading and listening </p>
      <p> passages online, or ask your teacher for any recordings that they may have </p>
